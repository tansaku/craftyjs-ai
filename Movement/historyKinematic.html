  <div>This simple demo has the character (red triangle) move to the target (green triangle) at a speed propotional to the distance vector between them, divided by the timeToTarget and clipped by the maximum speed.  More complex <a href="historyDynamic.html">dynamic demo</a> in progress.  Historical positions of the character are shown (faded red triangles), and these can be modified dynamically.  Hit reset button to re-run demo with new parameter settings.</div>
  <div><ol><li>top slider: radius = equals distance from target before we stop moving</li>
  <li>middle slider: maximum speed</li>
  <li>bottom slider: time to target = how many seconds it takes to get to the target</li></ol></div>

  
  <div>   TODO LIST</div>
   <ol><li>proper unit tests on everything ...</li>
    <li>would like to be able to scroll main object back and forward through path - just switch which clone is highlighted?  unnecessary now we can re run with history detached?</li>
    <li>would like to have history path extended to destination state ...</li>
    <li>if clones recorded location of target when they were created, could have repeated history tracking moving target ... </li>
  </ol></div>

    // A) would like to be able to set start parameters - just some button to press that causes Crafty.init() and Crafty.canvas.init()? or just Crafty.timer.pause? would need to have other items off canvas ... alternatively could have reset button that puts character (and target) back to original location and clears history ...
    // B) would like to be able to scroll main object back and forward through path - just switch which clone is highlighted?  or actually re run with history detached?
    // C) would like to have history path extended to destination state ...

    // 1. want to be able to scroll main highlighted object back and forward through history trail
    // 2. want to be able to play with time - maybe it's fine if we can just get this as a package that runs on a seeker, that will stop
    // coming to a stationary target ...
    // 3. want to be able to rotate the triangle
    // 4. to be able to adjust the position of the history path based on changing some parameters e.g. time to target etc. <-- this would be lovely but not practical???????? need a series of time slices ... and to calculate positions based on parameters for given time slice ...  DONE?

    // so either I want a print out of the instantenous 10 velocities <-- seems like this might help resolve question better ...
    // or I want to dynamically change the number of history items --- no that sounds wrong ...

    // so I've got the history items printed out, and I've also got something similar in a spreadsheet.

    // looking at it feels like it confirms to me that the time to target effects the point at which the kinematic arrival drops
    // below the max speed, and we start to see deceleration, but the key influence on the deceleration appears to be the decreasing
    // distance to the target, and timeToTarget is a constant modifier on that.

    // However there is an interaction in that once we drop below the max speed the rate at which we approach the target slows down, 
    // which effectively leads to a stronger breaking effect ... and we get the same thing whether we have a max speed or not
    // time to target is controlling how long it takes to get to the target - by reducing the magnitude of the velocity at each step
    // it further reduces the magnitude of the velocity at the next step because the character has not moved as close to the target
    // as they would without the timeToTarget penalty, so on the next step the timeToTarget penalty is now penalizing something
    // smaller than would have been the case if it were not there in the first place, i.e. it has a cumulative effect

    // so key thing is to try this with dynamic systems

    // also think about how to have a control to adjust the positions, values of the history elements ...
